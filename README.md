# Pokémon Orange
A Pokémon journey and personal project.

## Introduction
This project was created for a team assignment during Game Design I, and it is an ongoing project. This project is based on the popular games created by Game Freak Inc. It contains many of the same features as the original Pokémon games (see features below for a detailed list), but it also adds a more expansive multiplayer experience. Future updates will bring online multiplayer options to the game as well as a more complete experience.

## Notes
The most difficult aspect of this project so far is creating smooth and exciting battles. This process is not yet complete. There were also slight complications with integrating local networking because noone on our team had experience creating multiplayer content. After fumbling with GML for a while, we were able to adapt to create this feature.
