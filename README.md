# Pokémon Orange
A Pokémon journey and personal project

## Introduction
This project was created for a team assignment during Game Design I, and it is an ongoing project. This project is based on the popular Pokémon series created by Game Freak Inc. It contains many of the same features as the original Pokémon games (see features below for a detailed list), but it also adds a more expansive multiplayer experience. Future updates will bring online multiplayer options to the game as well as a more complete experience.

## Installation Instructions
If you are only interested in playing the game during development skip to the <a href="#playerInstall">game install section</a>.
If you are interested in viewing or editing the project files, continue below.

  <li>
    Once the installation has completed, click "Next". You are finished! Thanks for downloading the game!
  </li>
</ol>
Note: If the file you download appears larger than you think it should be, then you are correct! You have downloaded the project files as well as executable. I will change the location from which players download the game at a later date to avoid this concern. This is a temporary solution.

## Notes
The most difficult aspect of this project so far is creating smooth and exciting battles. This process is not yet complete. 

There were also slight complications with integrating local networking because noone on our team had experience creating multiplayer content. After fumbling with GML for a while, we were able to adapt to create this feature.
